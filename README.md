# Requirements
Text parsing:
* One screen; with edit field for input string and “Parse” button
* App contains dictionary of words
* When user presses “Parse” application will segment the input string into a space-
separated sequence of dictionary words if possible. Result will be displayed on the same
screen.
* For example, if the input string is "applepieshoe" and dictionary contains a standard set
of English words, then app would display the strings "apple”, “pie" and “shoe” as
output.
* The app should display all the words found in input string, for example if the input string
